                    'It's not the idea, it's the implementation that counts.'
                    Gottlieb Daimler is born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in
                    France, he attends the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various
                    technical activities in France and England, he starts work as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At
                    the end of 1863, he is appointed workshop inspector in a machine tool factory in Reutlingen, where
                    he meets Wilhelm Maybach in 1865. In 1872, he becomes Technical Director of the gas engine
                    manufacturer Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik, where he becomes familiar with Otto's four-stroke technology.
                    After differences with the Managing Director, he leaves the company in 1882. Daimler sets up a
                    development workshop in his greenhouse at his Cannstatt villa to concentrate on developing
                    petrol-driven four-stroke engines. Working with Wilhelm Maybach in 1884, he develops an internal
                    combustion engine known today as the 'Grandfather Clock'. With its compact, low-weight design, the
                    machine forms the basis for installation in a vehicle. The costs of trial operations soon consume
                    Daimler's entire fortune, however, so he is obliged to find business partners. He founds
                    'Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft' on 28 November 1890 together with Max Duttenhofer and his business
                    partner Wilhelm Lorenz. But while Duttenhofer wants to produce stationary engines, Daimler prefers
                    to focus on vehicle production, and a dispute ensues.
                </p>
                <p class="textDivTxt2">
                    After Wilhelm Maybach resigns in 1891 due to unacceptable terms of contract, Daimler resorts to a
                    ruse. He continues to build engines with Maybach, but the patents are all in his name. The
                    increasingly tense relationship with Duttenhofer and Lorenz lead them to exclude Daimler as a
                    shareholder. A deterioration in finances leads to stagnating technical development, which prompts
                    DMG to attempt to reinstate Maybach in 1895. He refuses, pointing out that he would not come back
                    without Daimler. In the end, commercial pressures result in both of them returning to the company.
                    Thanks to the Phoenix engine built by Maybach, the Daimler engine gains popularity abroad. A group
                    of English industrialists are prepared to pay 350,000 Marks for licensing rights. Maybach is
                    appointed Technical Director of DMG, and Gottlieb Daimler receives a position on the Technical Board
                    and becomes the Inspector General of the Supervisory Board. The return of both men to DMG is an
                    unexpected boost for the company. Gottlieb Daimler enjoys this rapid development for only a short
                    period of time. He dies of heart disease on 6 March 1900.

                    Carl Benz is born in Karlsruhe on 25 November 1844. His father dies in July 1846. Despite living on
                    limited financial means, his mother ensures that her son attends a grammar school and later studies
                    mechanical engineering. The young engineer advances quickly from a locksmith to a designer and
                    workshop foreman. In 1871, Carl Benz joins forces with 'mechanician' August Ritter to found his
                    first company, 'Carl Benz and August Ritter, Engineering Workshop', in Mannheim. When Ritter emerges
                    as an unreliable partner, Carl Benz is forced to pay him off using the dowry of his wife, Bertha
                    Ringer, and runs the company alone. From 1878, Carl Benz works intensively on a gas-driven
                    two-stroke engine to realise his vision of a 'vehicle without horses'. After long and laborious
                    attempts, he gets the engine running for the first time on New Year’s Eve in 1879. He founds the
                    'Gasmotorenfabrik Mannheim' (Mannheim Gas Engine Factory) as a shareholding company in October 1882.
                    Benz’s share in the company amounts to a mere 5 per cent, however, and he has only limited influence
                    in technical areas. His backers are primarily concerned with the safe business of stationary gas
                    engines.
